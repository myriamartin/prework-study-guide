        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web such us: text, image, header or list elements.</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. These elements are not visible.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites. One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
          <li>Use the var keyword to declare a variable. After the var keyword, use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.  </li>
          <li>We use the console.log() method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. Developers use console.log method daily to debug and test the code that they write.  </li>
          <li>To connect the script.js file to the index.html file we add the script file under the footer element and above the closing element for body </li>
          <li>Control flow: is the order in which a computer executes code in a file. Typically, JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true. We can have more than one condition by using else if.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is related in some way. Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types (boolean, string, numbers) in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over, for loop that can iterate over the array and log each topic in the console with only a few lines of code.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. You must call a function by name in order to execute it. </li>

         <li>Every deployed website has a unique address, which is known as a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL and allow users to find and visit our website.</li>
         <li>README file provides information about the project on GitHub.</li>
